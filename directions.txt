    Lyn Rummy is a fun game where you attempt to keep the "common
    area" intact with rummy-like stacks of cards:

        sets: 4S, 4H, 4D
        pure runs: 7S, 8S, 9S
        red-black runs: 2S, 3H, 4S, 5D, 6C

    All sets and runs must contain at least three cards. Runs
    can go "around the ace", so QS, KS, AS, 2S, 3S is a valid
    run.

    Take 2 standard playing-cards decks of 52 cards each. (no jokers)
    Shuffle the stack of 104 cards.

    Deal out 15 cards to each player. (In this case we still
    assume one player, so it's the solitaire flavor.)

    Players take turns, as in almost every other card game.

    On each turn, the player tries to get as many as their cards
    out on to the common area while keeping all the stacks legitimate.

    Here's the kicker, though! You can disturb the existing stacks
    and move as many cards around as you'd like. The only thing that
    matters at the end of your turn is that the common area is still
    clean. (The whole challenge of the game is mutating the board,
    although it's also perfectly fine just to extend existing sets
    and runs.)

    If a player can't get any of their cards out, they can draw from
    the deck for their turn.

    A quick caveat on sets: You cannot have duplicates. In other words,
    4H 4S 4H is illegal, because you have dups of 4H. Don't make your
    fellow players scold you with "NO DUPS!".
